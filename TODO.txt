Remaining features
------------------

* Places index
* POIs with multiple points
* POIs with polylines?
* Probably POIs display improvement (sidebar etc.)

Optimization (when needed)
--------------------------

* Basic optimization could probably be saving the project state (with all preloaded content etc.)
  into a JSON file and reloading it on startup (and checking that existing files are not newer than this JSON)

Other points
------------

* Should the generator be a separate project?  Will bring a lot of complexity.  Code cleanup, tests
  will be necessary
